Create a class Ticket with the following private variables
int ticketid;
int price;
static int availableTickets;


Include getters and setters methods in the Ticket class.

AvailableTickets should hold only positive value. Zero and negative values are not allowed.(This logic should be checked inside the corresponding setter method)

Write the following method in the Ticket class:

public int calculateTicketCost(int nooftickets) â€”this method should check the ticket availability, If the tickets are available, reduce the nooftickets from availableTickets and calculate the total amount as nooftickets*price  and return the total amount.  If the tickets are not available, this method should return -1.

Write a main method in the Main class to test the application.
