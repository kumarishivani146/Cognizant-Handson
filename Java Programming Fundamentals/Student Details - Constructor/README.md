Create a class Student with the private attributes

int studentId

String studentName, studentAddress, collegeName. 

Include appropriate getter methods.

Write 2 constructors for the Student class based on the below assumptions. 

Assume most of the students are from “NIT” college. So user has to give input whether the student is from NIT or not. 

If student belongs to NIT, give input as 'yes/YES' and  skip input for the attribute collegeName  and create student object with 3-argument constructor to initilze the values for studentId, studentName and studentAddress and  collegeName as “NIT”.
If student belongs to other college, give input as 'no/NO' and get college name from the user and create student object with 4-argument constructor to initialize all the values. 
Instead of Yes / No, if user enters different input then display 'Wrong Input' and get the input again.
Based on the above assumptions write the necessary constructors in the Student class.

Write a class StudentMain with the main method and test the application. 

Get all the input needed from the main method.
